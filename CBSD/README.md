# Cognitive, Behavioral, and Social Data

Using the dataset collected based on the responses of
519 people in 25 questions to evaluate personality and
related disorders based on the dimensional trait model
(DSM-5). Some models are constructed to distinguish
dishonest responses and reconstruct these answers into
honest responses. With this dataset, Random Forest
classifier (MLP), K-Means, and Multi-layer perceptron
give the best results with 96% accuracy among other
basic techniques like Logistic Regression and Decision
Tree. Moreover, we realized that people tend to fake
their answers in psychoticism and antagonism questions. For forecasting honest responses from a dishonest
person, the XGBOOST model gives the best result with
67.31% accuracy and the smallest mean error compared
to Support Vector Regression and LSTM models.
