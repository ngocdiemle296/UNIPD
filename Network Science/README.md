The project used the dataset generated by the Twitter
API with the hashtag #covid19 to analyze tweets related
to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since most of the collected
tweets are from the US, the official account of former
president Donald Trump plays a key role, and the topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic like #StayHome, #SocialDistancing, #China, and #lockdown were concerned the most.
