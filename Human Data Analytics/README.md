Classifying X-ray chest images into three classes - Pneumonia, COVID, and Normal by applying deep learning
and transfer learning. Four models are approached
to tackle classification: Convolutional neural network
(CNN), Dense convolutional network (DenseNet), VGG16,
and VGG19. The DenseNet model has the best performance with 93.45% accuracy, AUC = 0.98 for the COVID
case and recalls are 0.98, 0.96, and 0.86 for normal,
COVID, and pneumonia cases, respectively.
